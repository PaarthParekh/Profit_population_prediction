# Profit_population_prediction
First Machine Learning Model
Predict the profit based on only one feature, population. The function profit_population_model accepts three values, namely the training feature, training results, step value( alpha) and number of iterations you want it to run.
For example prediction I have uploaded the data, where the 1st column is the training feature and 2nd column is the training results. 
The output of the script will be the theta value. You can predict the result by multiplying the test feature with the theta value.
