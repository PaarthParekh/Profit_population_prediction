# Profit_population_prediction
First Machine Learning Model
Predict the profit based on only one feature, population. The function predict accepts four values, namely the training feature, training results, step value( alpha) and number of iterations you want it to run.
For example data prediction I have uploaded the data, where the 1st column is the training feature and 2nd column is the training results. 
The output of the script will be the prediction. 
You can obtain only the theta value as well, by just calling the profit_population_model, which accepts the same 4 values
